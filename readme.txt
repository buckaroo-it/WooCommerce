== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Minimum Requirements =
- WordPress 4.4.10
- WooCommerce 5.0

= How do I automatically install the plugin? =
1. Install the plugin through the plugins menu in wp-admin
2. Activate the 'Buckaroo WooCommerce' plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set your API key at WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout
4. Activate the payment methods you want in  WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout
5. You're done, the active payment methods should now be visible in your webshop's progress screen.

= I want to manually install the plugin, how can I do this? =
1. Download a .zip of the plugin from [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-buckaroo-bpe-gateway/)
2. Unzip the downloaded .zip package
3. Upload the directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
4. Activate the 'Buckaroo WooCommerce' plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. Set your API key at WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout
6. Activate the payment methods you want in  WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout
7. You're done, the active payment methods should now be visible in your webshop's progress screen.

= I have installed the plugin, but the transactions are not working. What's wrong? =
Verify that all data is entered correctly. This is the website site, the secret key, the thumbprint and the certificate that must be uploaded. Also check the Buckaroo report in the left-hand menu of your Wordpress environment. If you are creating test transactions, please go to plaza.buckaroo.nl. Then, under My Buckaroo -> Websites -> Choose your website through the filter at the top right -> 3.0 Settings, choose "Accept Test Transactions".

= The transactions are good and work in the Buckaroo Plaza, but the status in my WooCommerce environment does not change. Why is this? =
Very likely, push settings are not setup correctly. The push is used to update the status of the order in WooCommerce. Please refer to the manual and check your push settings at plaza.buckaroo.nl under My Buckaroo -> Websites -> Choose your website through the filter at the top right -> Push settings. Two issues:
- If your website is secure (URL starts with https instead of http), then the push URL must also start with https
- Check that the return fields in our Plaza are in "lowercase letters".

= The customer does not see the thank you page, after a successful order, how can I fix this? =
Probably the return fields are not yet in lowercase letters in our plaza under My Buckaroo -> Websites -> Choose your website through the filter at the top right -> Push settings. Also check whether the push settings are filled in (see the manual for information on how to set this). Additionally, you can check that the Secret Key in the Buckaroo Plaza corresponds to the Secret Key that was filled in during the configuration of the Buckaroo plugin in WooCommerce. Also, verify that the Secret Key contains only alphanumeric characters.

= 3.0.0 =

3.0.0 is a MAJOR release, it may break things so we advice to do additional testing and treat it with caution.

With 3.0.0 we are taking a big step in improving our services within WooCommerce. We have technically improved our installation and configuration process and made it more understandable for everyone. Below are some highlights of our improvements:

- Code upgrade: Removed a lot of duplication, started using constants for statuses and codes everywhere, removed unused services and code, started using code into common/single places, reduced long methods sizes.

- Improved logging: We upgraded our logging service and made it more flexible. Option to store in in files or database (or both).

- Improved our UI: We changed a lot, we improved and simplified our configuration process. Added a option to check you filled credentials, moved some advanced configuration to specific methods and changed icons for the payment methods to a single style/design.
